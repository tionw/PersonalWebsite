              <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
              <p>Although I was born in Los Angeles, Hong Kong is where I spent the better part of the first 12 years of my life. Growing up in Hong Kong meant living in a fast-paced environment and meeting people from everywhere around the world- experiences that I've grown to appreciate more and more.</p>

              <h3>New York</h3>
              <p>Attending the Stony Brook School in Long Island marked the beginning of an exciting new chapter in my life. Here, I learnt the importance of building character through challenge(intensive coursework), leadership(as x-country and swim team captain), and creativity(learning guitar and graphic design).</p>

              <p>One summer three years ago, I set foot on Boston College as part of the Class of 2020. Since then, I've discovered my passion for coding and math, joined the Marching Band, created and led the Esports Club of Boston College, and become the person I am today.</p>
